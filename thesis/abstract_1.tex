A downlink multi cell Multi User-Multiple Input Multiple-Output \ac{MU-MIMO} interference broadcast channel \ac{IBC}  is taken into account, where \ac{IBC} network is limited by multi user interference. The objective is to design a downlink \ac{DL} multiantenna communication with base stations \ac{BS} that perform cooperative precoding in a distributed fashion, where precoders maximizes the sum throughput of all users served by the coordinating \ac{BS}. The precoders are designed in such a way that the interference is reduced and the system through put is achieved. The base problem and algorithm requires, local knowledge of the channel and converge to the stationary points of the weighted sum rate maximization \ac{WSRM} problem. The problem is non convex and we use successive convex approximation \ac{SCA} to convert the problem to convex form by taking the Taylor series approximation.
