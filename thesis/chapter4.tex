We considered a distributed precoder design for \ac{WSRM} problem in \ac{MIMO}-\ac{IBC} networks over \ac{iid} channels, and proposed an approach that maximizes the user throughput  by relaxing the non convex constraint by a sequence of convex subsets using the \ac{SCA} method.  We considered mainly two different precoding techniques, the centralized and the distributed approach with practical  aspects, where we proposed several different methods like \ac{ADMM}, and also obtained practical iterative algorithm to obtain the precoder in a distributed manner by solving the \ac{KKT} for \ac{AP-GP} and \ac{MSE} reformulation with and without rate constraint. The proposed iterative algorithm requires few iterations and very limited exchange of information between the interfering \ac{BS}s to obtain effective precoders in a given number of iteration. Simulation plot and numerical results were used to compare the performance of the proposed algorithm.
