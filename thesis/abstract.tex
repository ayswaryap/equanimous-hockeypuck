A downlink multi-cell \ac{MU}-\ac{MIMO} \ac{IBC} model with multiple users contending for space-frequency resources in a given scheduling instant is taken into account. The objective is to design a downlink  precoders with \ac{BS}s that perform cooperative precoding in a distributed fashion, where precoders maximizes the sum throughput of all users served by the coordinating \ac{BS}. We propose a \ac{WSRM} problem, in which the precoders are designed in a decentralized approach for centralized algorithms using \ac{ADMM}, and also propose a practical iterative precoder design by solving the \ac{KKT} expressions for the \ac{AP-GP} and \ac{MSE} reformulation, which requires lesser number of information exchange in every iteration and update. The precoders are designed in such a way that the interference is reduced and the system throughput is achieved. The base problem and algorithm requires, local knowledge of the channel and converge to the stationary points of the \ac{WSRM} problem. However, problem is non convex, therefore we use \ac{SCA} and \ac{AO} to convert the proposed problem into convex form to handle. Simulation plots and numerical results are used to compare the proposed algorithm to the existing solutions.
